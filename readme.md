# **Decentralized Identity (`did:web`) Integration with Microsoft Entra Verified ID**

## **📌 Overview**

Organizations today need **secure, decentralized, and user-controlled identity solutions** to enhance  **privacy, security, and interoperability** . This repository provides a **step-by-step guide** to integrating **DID:web** (Decentralized Identifiers using a web domain) with  **Microsoft Entra Verified ID** , enabling organizations to  **issue and verify Verifiable Credentials (VCs) securely** .

## **💡 What is a Decentralized Identifier (DID)?**

A **Decentralized Identifier (DID)** is a globally unique identifier that allows individuals, organizations, and devices to authenticate  **without relying on a centralized authority** . Unlike traditional identity solutions that depend on  **centralized directories** , **DIDs enable self-sovereign identity (SSI)** where the  **user owns and controls their identity** .

### **DID Methods**

There are multiple ways to create a  **DID** , such as:

* **`did:ion`** (Uses Sidetree over Bitcoin for tamper-proof DIDs)
* **`did:key`** (Ephemeral DIDs generated on-the-fly)
* **`did:ethr`** (Ethereum-based decentralized identity)
* **`did:web`** (DIDs hosted on an organization’s domain)

Among these,  **DID:web is the simplest and most enterprise-friendly approach** .

---

## **🌍 Why Use `did:web`?**

`did:web` is a **lightweight DID method** that allows organizations to create and host DIDs on their **own domain** (`.well-known/did.json`).

### **🔹 Key Benefits of `did:web`**

✅ **No Blockchain Required** – Unlike `did:ion`, `did:web` does not depend on a blockchain, making it  **cheaper and easier to deploy** .

✅ **Enterprise-Ready** – Organizations can **control their own DID infrastructure** using their domain name.

✅ **Interoperability** – Works with  **Microsoft Entra Verified ID** ,  **W3C Verifiable Credentials** , and  **Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) standards** .

✅ **Trust & Transparency** – Users can verify credentials  **directly from an organization's website** .

✅ **Fast & Scalable** – No need for  **complex cryptographic anchoring on a blockchain** , making `did:web` a scalable solution.

## **🔐 How This Integration Works**

By integrating  **`did:web` with Microsoft Entra Verified ID** , organizations can:

* **Issue verifiable credentials** for employees, customers, and partners.
* **Allow users to authenticate** using their credentials  **without passwords** .
* **Enhance security and privacy** while remaining compliant with  **decentralized identity standards** .

## **⚙️ Authentication & Verification Flow**

The following diagram represents the  **authentication flow using `did:web` and Entra Verified ID** .

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Org_DID_Web as Organization (did:web)
    participant Entra_VID as Microsoft Entra Verified ID
    participant Verifier_App as Application (Verifier)

    User->>Org_DID_Web: Request Verifiable Credential
    Org_DID_Web-->>Entra_VID: Issue Verifiable Credential
    Entra_VID-->>User: Credential Issued
    User->>Verifier_App: Present Credential for Authentication
    Verifier_App-->>Entra_VID: Verify Credential
    Entra_VID-->>Verifier_App: Credential Validated
    Verifier_App-->>User: Access Granted
```

**📌 What This Diagram Shows**

1. **User requests a Verifiable Credential (VC)** from an organization that uses  **`did:web`** .
2. The **organization requests Entra Verified ID** to issue a credential.
3. **Entra Verified ID issues a verifiable credential** to the user.
4. The **user presents their credential** to an application (verifier).
5. The **application verifies the credential** with Entra Verified ID.
6. If the credential is  **valid** , the  **user is granted access** .

## **🏛️ Use Cases for `did:web` + Entra Verified ID**

🚀 **Enterprise Identity & Access Management (IAM)** – Employees use Verifiable Credentials instead of passwords.

📜 **Regulatory Compliance & KYC (Know Your Customer)** – Governments and banks can verify customers **without storing sensitive data** centrally.

🛂 **Borderless Digital Identity** – Universities, travel agencies, and healthcare providers issue credentials that  **work across different platforms** .

🔐 **Passwordless Authentication** – Employees log in using their  **verifiable credentials instead of passwords** , reducing phishing risks.

## **📖 How to Set Up**

To integrate **DID:web** with  **Microsoft Entra Verified ID** , follow the step-by-step guide:

🔗 **[Setup Guide](https://github.com/Cloudstrucc/cs-identity/blob/main/did-vid.md)**

**Steps Covered:**

1. **Generate a `did:web` identifier** and host `did.json` on your domain.
2. **Configure Microsoft Entra Verified ID** as an issuer.
3. **Issue and verify Verifiable Credentials (VCs)** for users.
4. **Enable authentication using Verifiable Credentials** .

---

## **💡 Why This Matters**

✅ **User-Controlled Identities** – Eliminates reliance on centralized identity providers (Google, Facebook, etc.).

✅ **Privacy-First** – Reduces data collection while ensuring  **secure and verifiable credentials** .

✅ **Enterprise-Ready** – Organizations can issue and verify credentials  **at scale** .

✅ **Interoperable with W3C Standards** – Ensures compatibility across different identity providers.
