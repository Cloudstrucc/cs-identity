Integrating Entra Verified ID with the Sidetree protocol involves configuring Sidetree to manage DIDs while enabling interaction with Entra Verified ID for credential issuance and verification. Here's a step-by-step guide:

---

### **1. Understand the Components**

Before you begin, ensure you understand the following:

* **Entra Verified ID** : Microsoft's solution for verifiable credentials and DIDs.
* **Sidetree Protocol** : A scalable, decentralized DID management protocol that operates on existing blockchains (e.g., Bitcoin or Ethereum).

---

### **2. Prerequisites**

1. **Set Up Entra Verified ID**
   * Configure your **Entra Verified ID tenant** in Azure AD.
   * Enable verifiable credential issuance and configure your  **VC templates** .
   * Follow the [Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/verifiable-credentials/) to configure templates for your use case.
  
2. **Set Up Sidetree**
   * Clone the Sidetree GitHub repository:
  
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/decentralized-identity/sidetree.git
     cd sidetree
     ```

   * Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
     ```

   * Review the [Sidetree documentation](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/sidetree/blob/main/docs/README.md) for additional configuration details.
  
3. **Blockchain Node** (for Sidetree)

### **Use a Lightweight Bitcoin Node**

If you don't have the resources for a full node, you can use Bitcoin Testnet or a third-party service.

1. Bitcoin Testnet:
Install Bitcoin Core and configure it to use the testnet:

```conf
testnet=1
server=1
txindex=1
rpcuser=<your_rpc_user>
rpcpassword=<your_rpc_password>
zmqpubrawblock=tcp://127.0.0.1:28332
zmqpubrawtx=tcp://127.0.0.1:28333
```

Start Bitcoin Core in testnet mode:

```bash
    bitcoind -testnet -daemon
```

Update Sidetree to use the testnet's blockchain URI.

### **Configure Sidetree**

1. **Update Sidetree Configuration**
   * Navigate to the Sidetree configuration files (e.g., `config.json` in the ION implementation).
   * Specify the DID method you'd like to use. For example, for ION:
  
     ```json
     {
       "methodName": "ion",
       "blockchainServiceUri": "<YOUR_BLOCKCHAIN_NODE_URI>"
     }
     ```

2. **Run Sidetree**
   * Start the Sidetree service:
  
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

---

### **4. Create a DID Using Sidetree**

1. Use Sidetree to generate a DID:
   * Use the Sidetree client SDK or API to create a DID:
  
    ```bash
     curl -X POST \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{"type": "create", "content": {}}' \
       http://localhost:3000/
     ```

   * This will return a DID that you can store in your application.
2. Resolve the DID using Sidetree:

   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3000/resolve?did=<your_did>
   ```

---

### **5. Integrate Entra Verified ID with Sidetree**

1. **Modify Your VC Templates**
   * In Entra Verified ID, include the Sidetree DID in your verifiable credential templates as the **subject** of the credential.
   * Example `rules` configuration:

    ```json
     {
       "id": "sidetree-did",
       "type": "DID",
       "pattern": "did:ion:.*"
     }
     ```

2. **Issue a Verifiable Credential**
   * Use Entra Verified ID's API to issue credentials with a Sidetree DID as the subject:

     ```http
     POST https://<tenant>.verifiablecredentials.azure.com/v1.0/issue
     Content-Type: application/json

     {
       "subject": {
         "id": "did:ion:<sidetree_did>",
         "claims": {
           "name": "Alice Doe",
           "age": 30
         }
       },
       "type": ["VerifiableCredential"]
     }
     ```

3. **Verify a Credential**
   * Use Entra Verified ID's verification API:
  
     ```http
     POST https://<tenant>.verifiablecredentials.azure.com/v1.0/verify
     Content-Type: application/json

     {
       "credential": "<VC_CONTENT>"
     }
     ```

---

### **6. Synchronize Credential Status with Sidetree**

1. **Credential Status**
   * Use Sidetree's DID document capabilities to include **credential status** endpoints, enabling revocation or updates to credentials.
   * Update the DID document with a status endpoint:
  
    ```json
     {
       "service": [
         {
           "id": "status",
           "type": "CredentialStatus",
           "serviceEndpoint": "https://example.com/status"
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

2. **Update the DID Document**
   * Use Sidetree's API to update the DID document:
  
     ```bash
     curl -X POST \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{"type": "update", "content": {"service": [...]}}' \
       http://localhost:3000/
     ```

---

### **7. Testing and Deployment**

1. **Test the Integration**
   * Issue and verify credentials using Entra Verified ID.
   * Resolve and update the DID using Sidetree.
2. **Deploy Sidetree**
   * Host the Sidetree service on a production server.
   * Ensure your blockchain node is synced and reliable.
3. **Deploy Entra Verified ID Templates**
   * Finalize and deploy your VC templates for production use.

---

### **8. Monitor and Maintain**

* Regularly monitor your blockchain node and Sidetree service for issues.
* Update VC templates and Sidetree configurations as needed.
